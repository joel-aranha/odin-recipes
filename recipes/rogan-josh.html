            <li> salt as required</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ghee</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon peppercorns</li>
            <li>4 red chilli</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tablespoon coriander powder</li>
            <li>2 pinch saffron</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red chilli powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoon fennel seeds powder</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tablespoon all purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare this delicacy, first, prepare the saffron milk by soaking saffron in milk. Next, put a pressure cooker and heat ghee in it. When the ghee is hot enough, add the whole spices and fry for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Then, add whole red chillies, cumin seeds and asafoetida in the pressure cooker and fry for a few seconds. Afterwards, add the mutton pieces in it and stir well. Cover with the lid but don’t close it and cook the mutton for 5-6 minutes on medium to high flame. You will notice the meat will turn light brown in colour. After 5 minutes, remove the lid and add 1/2 cup of water in it and stir well with the spices. This will help the mutton in soaking the flavours of all the spices. Then, lower the flame and cook the mutton for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, take a small bowl and add all-purpose flour along with yoghurt in it, mix well. In this yoghurt mixture, add saffron milk (step 1), salt, fennel powder, coriander powder, Kashmiri red chilli powder and dry ginger powder (sonth powder). Mix all the spices well in the yoghurt. Once done, add into the pressure cooker. Stir well using a ladle and cook the mutton in yoghurt for at least a minute.</li>
            <li>Then, add 1 cup of water in the pressure cooker and slow cook the mutton for 1-2 hours. Stir in between so that it doesn’t stick to the bottom. You can also pressure cook the mutton for 5-6 whistles. Once done, garnish and serve hot with chapati or naan. You can also enjoy this dish with rice.</li>
