This is my first project with 'The Odin Project'.
It is a webpage that uses images, h1 links and lists to display recipe.

Index:

1 Add the boiler plate HTML
2 Add the h1 heading as "Odin Recipes"
3 Add a ul linking to the recipes. The recipes will be in the recipe folder

Recipe Folder:(Create atleast 3 pages)

1 Create the HTML file for each recipe and give it the recipes name.
2 Include a h1 heading with the recipes name as its content.
3 An image of the dish below the H1
4 Under the image there should be a description heading followed by a description heading followedby a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
5 Under the description add an ingredients heading followed by an unordered list needed for the recipe.
6 Under the ingredients add the steps as an ordered list
