        <h2>Sweet & Delicious Muffins</h2>
        <p>
            These light and spongy gluten-free muffins are made with almond flour instead of regular flour. Nonfat Greek yogurt is one of the secrets to keeping the texture so fluffy.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups blanched almond flour </li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda </li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>⅔ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted </li>
            <li>½ cup nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, divided </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon blanched almond flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Sift 3 cups almond flour together with baking powder, salt, and baking soda into a bowl and set asid</li>
            <li>Mix eggs, sugar, melted butter, Greek yogurt, and vanilla extract together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add flour mixture into the wet ingredients and mix until well combined, but be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>oss 3/4 cup of the chocolate chips with 1 tablespoon almond flour in a bowl so that the chips are lightly coated. Fold the coated chocolate chips into the batter. Distribute the batter evenly between 10 paper-lined muffin cups, filling the cups all the way to the top. Sprinkle remaining chocolate chips over the tops of the muffins.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the muffins comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool muffins in the pan on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
